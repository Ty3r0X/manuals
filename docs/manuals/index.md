Thanks to [Clement Ong](https://ongclement.com/) for the above [page listing](https://ongclement.com/blog/github-pages-indexing-directory-copy) as it is a very heavily modified version of theirs. Unfortunately I don't know what the original is licensed under. :(. All other `index.md` files contain the same modified versions of the same Clement Ong code but lack this notice, so consider this as a notice for those also.
